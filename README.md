# Inventory-Tracking-System
The system allows a user to count the quantity of a particular item and then use the 4 x 4 keypad to enter that quantity. The operator then scans the barcode of the item, which enters the item’s identification into the system. This inventory information is stored in the system temporarily. When done counting and identifying items, the operator presses a key and the inventory is transmitted by RF to a base station for storage in a database. The system uses an AVR128DB48 micrcontroller, using AVR assembly to code the inventory tracking sytem and UART and LoraWAN communication protocols to communicate between devices.
